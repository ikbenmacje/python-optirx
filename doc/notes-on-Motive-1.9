The current version of Motive is 1.9.0.
The current version of the NatNet SDK is 2.9.0 (10/11/2015).

Some of the differences apparent from the source code for PacketClient.cpp in
2.9.0 from the version previously included in this package:

Lines  98-101: new global variables
Lines 146-159: new reporting of command responses in global variables
Lines 430-453: new interactive playback control commands for 'w' key
Lines 465-509: new SendCommand function called from lines 430-453
Lines 796-809: addition of tracking flags to rigid markers (since 2.6)
Lines 859-887: addition of force plate data (no way to test this) (since 2.9)

The rigid marker tracking flags are already supported in optirx._unpack_rigid_bodies().

The chief addition for NatNet 2.9 appears to be the force plate data, which adds
another header to the frame data processed in optirx._unpack_frameofdata().
